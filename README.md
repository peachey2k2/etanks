# etanks
This is a program I made to keep track of my ender tanks with in modpacks involving a lot of fluid passiving. The saved tanks are colored and allows fuzzy searching to make youÄ±r job easier while using ender tanks.

> [!NOTE]
> 1) Keep in mind that you'll need an advanced computer for coloring to work.
> 2) On a pocket computer, most most of the text will not fit into the screen, so prefer using the regular computers.

# Installation
Simply run the following command.
```
pastebin run pMr1ELTP
```

If you don't have access to pastebin, you can also `wget` it directily from this repo.
```
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peachey2k2/etanks/main/install.lua
```

# Usage
First, run `etanks gen` to generate a new empty data file. If you already have a data file, this will clear all its contents.

After that, simply run `etanks` to open the program.

**To add a fluid**, type its name, hit `enter`, select `Add fluid` and select its colors.

Once you add some fluids, you can search through them by typing into the same field. It'll fuzzy-find through all the saved fluids and sort them appropriately. You can hit the `delete` key to clear the input field. All these functions can also be used while selecting colors.

**To edit/remove a fluid**, select a fluid, hit `enter` and then select the desired option.

**To quit the program**, hit `ctrl`. The file is saved after each change, so you don't need to worry about that.
