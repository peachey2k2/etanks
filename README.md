# etanks
This is a program I made to keep track of my ender tanks with in modpacks involving a lot of fluid passiving. The saved tanks are colored and allows fuzzy searching to make youÄ±r job easier while using ender tanks.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that you'll need an advanced computer for coloring to work.
